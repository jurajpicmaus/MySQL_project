# MySQL_project
I created small database called globe. This database consists of 5 tables: states, presidents, capitals, mayors and continents. Tables are related. Each table has only 20 records except table continents (only 7 records). Most of the data in tables are inaccurate, I made them up. They are just for learning purposes. I created this database when I was learning MySQL. It was done in MySQL Workbench. Database is good for practising basic commands in MySQL (SELECT, JOIN,...) Database is suitable for beginners who want to learn and practise. There are some views and stored procedures as well.
